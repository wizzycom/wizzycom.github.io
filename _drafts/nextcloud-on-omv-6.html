<p>As the title states. Again, this solution is without the use of docker. It is just a straight forward installation of Nextcloud 18.0.3 on OMV 5 using Nginx (php-fpm)  with PHP 7.3 that is already installed and MariaDB as our database server. In order to work on port 80 or port 443, we will have to change the OMV web ports to 8080 and 8443. You can achieve this via “General settings” on the OMV web interface. This guide asumes that Nextcloud will user ports TCP/80 and TCP/443. Everything that is marked RED, needs your attention.</p>
