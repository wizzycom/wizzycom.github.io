<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>My name is Kostas. I work as a data communications engineer. Data networking is my passion, but I also love open source, linux. As a newbie on linux, there were times that I had reached my knowledge limits but fortunately there are many people on the internet that share their knowledge. So I decided to do the same.</p>
<p>In this blog, I post step-by-step, everything that I make, from hardware to software, in order to help others.</p>
<p>And I do that because it is fun.</p>
<p>So if you read this, I hope you will start doing the same.</p>
