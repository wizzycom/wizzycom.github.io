Hello all!

My name is Kostas. I work as a senior data communications engineer. Data networking is my passion, but I also love GNU/linux and open source projects. As a newbie on NGU/linux, there were times that I had reached my knowledge limits but fortunately there were many people on the internet that share their knowledge. So I decided to do the same.

In this blog, I post step-by-step, everything that I make, from hardware to software, in order to help others.

And I do that because it is fun. So if you read this, I hope you will start doing the same.
