Dump1090 is an ADS-B decoder and it is used with the RTL-SDR dongle. Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast or ADS-B is the system that is used by aircrafts to transmit their GPS position. Dump1090 receives this information from the  RTL-SDR dongle and prints out the location of the aircraft on google maps.

This guide will cover the installation of dump1090. To work, you neet to have the RTL-SDR dongle and of course an antenna tuned to 1090MHz .

First, lets install some packages and the EPEL repository.

```
yum install epel-release
yum install usbutils git gcc rtl-sdr rtl-sdr-devel libusbx-devel libusbx
```

Then we have to clone and compile

```
cd /usr/share
git clone git://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090.git
cd  dump1090
make
```

After that, we have to blacklist some modules to prevent issues with the dongle. Create file rtl-sdr-blacklist.conf on /etc/modprobe.d

```
nano /etc/modprobe.d/rtl-sdr-blacklist.conf
```

Add the following :

```
blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu
blacklist e4000
blacklist rtl2832
```

We have to craete a systemd script to start/stop dump1090.

```
nano /usr/lib/systemd/system/dump1090.service
```

Add the following

```
[Unit]
Description=dump1090

[Service]
WorkingDirectory=/usr/share/dump1090/
ExecStart=/usr/share/dump1090/dump1090 --interactive --net --net-http-port 8080
StandardOutput=null
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Finally let's enable and start dump1090

```
systemctl enable dump1090.service
systemctl start dump1090.service
```

Go to http://server\_ip:8080. If everything is working as expected you will see the map with the aircrafts.

Good luck
