<p>This is for those who are having the HTTP service of mikrotik activated on the internet.</p>
<p>On March 2017 Wikileaks published some documents that supposed to belong to CIA under the name of Vault 7, describing that CIA has an exploit called "ChimayRed" Â by which can inject malicious code on RouterOS if the HTTP service is not protected.</p>
<p>You can find info and information on solving this, <a href="https://forum.mikrotik.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=119308&amp;sid=a349c66d9cd9e7e9afa710b129568a7f">here</a>.</p>
