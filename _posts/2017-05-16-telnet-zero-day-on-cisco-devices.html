<p>Cisco announced a remote code execution vulnerability that affects telnet on catalyst series devices. Once again this has to do with the documents leaked by Wikileaks, known as Vault 7.</p>
<p>Cisco recommends to enable only SSH access on the devices affected, if possible. For devices that do not support SSH, VTY access lists may be applied to reduce the risk.</p>
<p>More information about theÂ vulnerability and the devices affected, can be found <a href="https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170317-cmp">here</a>.</p>
