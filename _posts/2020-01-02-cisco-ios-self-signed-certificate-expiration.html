<p>On Jan 1, 2020 all self signed certificates that were generated on IOS/IOS-XE platforms got expired. After that time your device will not be able to generate self signed certificates.</p>
<p>There are some work arounds :</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain a valid certificate from a 3rd part Certificate Authority</li>
<li>Use the IOS CA Server to generate a new certificate</li>
<li>Use OpenSSL to generate a new self-signed certificate</li>
<li>Update your system, if possible, to a fixed SSC IOS version</li>
</ul>
<p>Systems affected :</p>
<ul>
<li>All IOS 12.x</li>
<li>all IOS 15.x prior to 15.6(3)M7, 15.7(3)M5, 15.8(3)M3, 15.9(3)M</li>
<li>all IOS-XE prior to 16.9.1</li>
</ul>
