If you suddenly loose Internet access, you can play an endless running game. This only works if your computer isn't connected to the Internet.

Meet T. Rex. He shows up when ChromeÂ can't connect to the Internet. It looks like this:![t-rex]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/06/t-rex-300x113.png)

If you see the above, just hit the space bar. The goal is to avoid anything that is in your way by hitting the space bar.

Have fun
