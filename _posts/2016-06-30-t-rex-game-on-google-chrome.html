<p>If you suddenly loose Internet access, you can play an endless running game. This only works if your computer isn't connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>Meet T. Rex. He shows up when ChromeÂ can't connect to the Internet. It looks like this:<!--more--><img class=" wp-image-141 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016/06/t-rex-300x113.png" alt="t-rex" width="356" height="134" /></p>
<p>If you see the above, just hit the space bar. The goal is to avoid anything that is in your way by hitting the space bar.</p>
<p>Have fun</p>
